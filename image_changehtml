 	<h2> Paddle Ball </h2>
 	<p id = "bold"> Description: </p>

 	<p>Paddle ball is a game in which a ball bounces around a window, and the player moves a paddle back and forth across the screen to try and keep the ball up in the air.</p>

 	<h2> Pig </h2>
 	<p id = "bold"> Description: </p>
 	<p> Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two options: 
 	</p>
 	<p>	Roll: If the player rolls a 1, the player scores nothing for this turn, and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls a number 2 - 6, the number on the die is added to the player's turn total, and the player's turn continues. 
 	</p>
 	<p> Hold: The player turn total is added to the player's overall score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

 	<h2> Obamicon </h2>
 	<p id = "bold"> Description: </p>
 	<p> You can get a similar effect if you look at each pixel’s RGB, or red green blue, values. RGB values work like light. 
 	</p
 	<p> If you add all the values together, you get a number that correlates to how “light” the color is. Lighter colors get colorized yellow. Medium/light colors get coded as light blue. Medium/dark colors are red and very dark colors get coded as dark blue.
